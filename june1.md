## Creating a Page with GitHub

In this section, we'll create a very minimal webpage with basic information.
- Who are you?
- What projects are you working on this summer?
- What's your favorite summer food? 


1. [Create a new Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

2. [Add a new file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/creating-new-files) called `index.html`

3. You can start with the minimum needed then add your own content. 
```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
   ```
4. Add a new blank file called `.nojekyll`
5. [Enable Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) in Settings and note your page's address
6. When done, post your link on Slack. 
7. Feel free to give your page some character and individuality.
